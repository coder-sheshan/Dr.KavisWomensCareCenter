            In the past, infertility was commonly considered to be solely a
            female probelm. It is now recognized that a couple's infertility is
            just as likely to stem from problems in the male partner also. After
            couple's with infertility undergo testing, about 40 percent of the
            cases are found to be from female factors and another 40 percent
            from male factors. In 10 percent of couples, infertility factors are
            found in both the man and woman. In the remaining 10 percent, the
            infertility remains unexplained after testing. Nowadays many new
            advanced treatments can help us overcome these fertility problems

            Involuntary childlessness or infertility places a massive agony on a
            couple. The cause can be missing, blocked or damaged fallopian
            tubes, hormonal defects, endometriosis, polycystic ovaries, Uterine
            Anomalies in women and poor semen quality, low sperm count, absence
            of sperms, defective motility of sperms in men. Other factors like
            stress, smoking, age, sexual problems also reduce the chances of
            conception.

            Pelvic Adhesions, which are also called scar tissue, are possibly
            one of the most common and misunderstood conditions associated with
            40% of infertility cases and 50% cases of chronic pelvic pain. They
            can occur as a result of endometriosis, pelvic infection, and
            previous abdominal or pelvic surgery. But they are not a disease;
            rather they are your body’s natural response in trying to heal after
            injury, trauma or inflammation. However, they can affect fertility
            as they can impair the egg’s passage from the ovary, or interfere
            with the fallopian tube’s ability to receive it.

            A bicornuate uterus is heart-shaped rather than the upside-down
            pear-shape.A unicornuate uterus is banana-shaped with a single
            fallopian tube. If you have a unicornuate uterus, there’s a good
            chance you’ll still have two ovaries but only one will be connected
            to your uterus.An arcuate uterus is the mildest form of the
            abnormality, and looks quite similar to a normal uterus, but it has
            a slight dip or arc at the top. Intra uterine septums – Complete or
            partial.Surgical correction otherwise known as Septal resection &
            Metroplasty is the most recommended line of treatment for a septate
            or bicornuate uterus. Soon after the surgery, pregnancy can be
            attempted and your chance for a successful pregnancy is excellent.

            PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) refers to a condition caused by
            hormonal imbalances. Women suffering from PCOS produce higher than
            normal amounts of male hormones. This affects ovulation and can
            result in irregular periods. In some cases, women suffering from
            PCOS may have irregular periods. This, in turn, can make it harder
            for these women to conceive. In fact, PCOS is one of the most common
            causes of female infertility. PCOS can be diagnosed with an
            ultrasound. Some of the symptoms that you could experience if you
            are having PCOS are heavy bleeding, unwanted hair growth, acne and
            hormonal imbalances.
